# Hand Gesture Calculator using java,OpenCV

This is a fun and interactive calculator that uses your hand gestures to perform basic math operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Built using Java and OpenCV, the program uses your webcam to detect the number of fingers you show, interprets them as numbers or operators, and calculates the result in real time.

The goal of this project was to explore how computer vision can be used to build natural and hands-free interfaces. Instead of typing, you just raise your fingers and perform simple gestures to carry out calculations.

All processing is done locally, and the app doesn't require any internet connection. It runs entirely on your system and works with any standard webcam.

This project was a great way to combine image processing, gesture recognition, and Java programming into a real-world application.
